## Introduction

This dashboard explores attendance trends for the Los Angeles Dodgers from 1958 to 2024. It includes a visual overview of total season attendance by year, offering a clear look at how fan turnout has shifted across decades. The data was compiled from public records and includes a few missing entries for unusual seasons (e.g., COVID years), which are noted but not removed to preserve historical context. \## Season Attendance Over Time

```{r}
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)

# Load your dataset
dodgers <- read_csv("Dodgers_Attendance_Data.csv")

# Simple line plot
ggplot(dodgers, aes(x = Year, y = Total_Season_Attendance)) +
  geom_line(color = "dodgerblue", size = 1.2) +
  labs(
    title = "Dodgers Season Attendance (1958–2024)",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Total Attendance"

## Dodgers vs. National League Average Attendance

This chart compares the Dodgers' total season attendance to the National League average for each year. It highlights how consistently the Dodgers have led the league in fan turnout — with only a few exceptions.

```{r}
# Convert data into long format for grouped plotting
dodgers_long <- dodgers %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(Total_Season_Attendance, NL_Avg_Attendance),
    names_to = "Category",
    values_to = "Attendance"
  )

# Plot
ggplot(dodgers_long, aes(x = Year, y = Attendance, color = Category)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.2) +
  labs(
    title = "Dodgers vs. NL Average Season Attendance (1958–2024)",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Attendance",
    color = ""
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(
    values = c("Total_Season_Attendance" = "dodgerblue", "NL_Avg_Attendance" = "gray40"),
    labels = c("Dodgers", "NL Average")
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
