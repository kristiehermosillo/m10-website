My goal is to help teams understand what’s working, what’s not, and how to communicate better with the people they’re trying to reach. I’ve been building skills in data visualization, dashboards, and interactive reporting so I can translate numbers into something useful. Eventually, I’d like to work somewhere that values both strategy and execution—where I can contribute to meaningful campaigns with real results."

Even during league-wide downturns or disrupted seasons, the Dodgers have remained a reliable draw.

    "text": "Essay on Shiny Apps\n\nWhat is a Shiny App?\nShiny is an R package that turns analysis into interactive web applications using R.\n\n\nHow It Works\n\nUI is defined using fluidPage, sidebarLayout, and other layout functions.\nServer logic lives in a reactive function that listens for input.\nApps can be launched locally or hosted online (e.g., shinyapps.io).\n\n\n\nTeaching It to Coworkers\nIf I were introducing Shiny to a teammate, I’d start by showing a basic layout with inputs and outputs. Then I’d walk them through how changes to an input — like a slider or dropdown — instantly update the visual or output using reactive logic. The key is that the UI and server components talk to each other live, making the app dynamic and customizable."
