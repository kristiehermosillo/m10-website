My goal is to help teams understand what’s working, what’s not, and how to communicate better with the people they’re trying to reach. I’ve been building skills in data visualization, dashboards, and interactive reporting so I can translate numbers into something useful. Eventually, I’d like to work somewhere that values both strategy and execution—where I can contribute to meaningful campaigns with real results.\n\n## Skills\n\n-   R / Quarto / Shiny / Shinylive\n-   Python / Tableau\n-   Data cleaning and dashboarding\n-   Research communication\n\n## Education\nA.S.

Then I’d walk them through how changes to an input — like a slider or dropdown — instantly update the visual or output using reactive logic. The key is that the UI and server components talk to each other live, making the app dynamic and customizable.\n\n---\n\n## Essay on Shinylive\n\n### What is Shinylive?\n\nShinylive is a lightweight version of Shiny that runs **entirely in the browser**, no server required.\n\n### Comparison with Shiny Apps\n\n| Feature         | Shiny                        | Shinylive                   |\n|-----------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Server Needed   | Yes                          | No                          |\n| Deployment      | shinyapps.io, self-hosting   | Quarto Pub, GitHub Pages    |\n| Best For        | Heavy computation            | Lightweight, browser-only apps |\n\n### Pros and Cons\n\n**Pros:**\n- Super easy to share — no hosting or server needed\n- Runs in the browser\n- Great for small apps and demos\n\n**Cons:**\n- Can't use all R packages (only browser-compatible ones)\n- Slower with large datasets \n- Not ideal for heavy data processing or authentication \n---\n*This site was built in Quarto as part of the M10 hands-on assignment.
