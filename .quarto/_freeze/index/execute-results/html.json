My goal is to help teams understand what’s working, what’s not, and how to communicate better with the people they’re trying to reach. I’ve been building skills in data visualization, dashboards, and interactive reporting so I can translate numbers into something useful. Eventually, I’d like to work somewhere that values both strategy and execution—where I can contribute to meaningful campaigns with real results.\n\n## Skills\n\n-   R / Quarto / Shiny / Shinylive\n-   Python / Tableau\n-   Data cleaning and dashboarding\n-   Research communication\n\n## Education\nA.S.

Even during league-wide downturns or disrupted seasons, the Dodgers have remained a reliable draw. The comparison underscores the team's legacy, loyalty, and lasting impact on Major League Baseball attendance trends.\n\n---\n\n## Essay on Shiny Apps\n\n### What is a Shiny App?\n\nShiny is an R package that turns analysis into interactive web applications using R.\n\n### How It Works\n\n- UI is defined using `fluidPage`, `sidebarLayout`, and other layout functions.\n- Server logic lives in a reactive function that listens for input.\n- Apps can be launched locally or hosted online (e.g., shinyapps.io).\n\n### Teaching It to Coworkers\n\nIf I were introducing Shiny to a teammate, I’d start by showing a basic layout with inputs and outputs. Then I’d walk them through how changes to an input — like a slider or dropdown — instantly update the visual or output using reactive logic. The key is that the UI and server components talk to each other live, making the app dynamic and customizable.\n\n---\n\n## Essay on Shinylive\n\n### What is Shinylive?\n\nShinylive is a lightweight version of Shiny that runs **entirely in the browser**, no server required.\n\n### Comparison with Shiny Apps\n\n| Feature         | Shiny                        | Shinylive                   |\n|-----------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Server Needed   | Yes                          | No                          |\n| Deployment      | shinyapps.io, self-hosting   | Quarto Pub, GitHub Pages    |\n| Best For        | Heavy computation            | Lightweight, browser-only apps |\n\n### Pros and Cons\n\n**Pros:**\n- Super easy to share — no hosting or server needed\n- Runs in the browser\n- Great for small apps and demos\n\n**Cons:**\n- Can't use all R packages (only browser-compatible ones)\n- Slower with large datasets \n- Not ideal for heavy data processing or authentication \n\n\n---\n*This site was built in Quarto as part of the M10 hands-on assignment.
